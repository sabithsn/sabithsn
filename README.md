Hello! I am currently working on the Moonworks Mission as the CEO of Moonworks AI. The Mission is to develop Omnimodal Sovereign AI models and to also empower human roles and human creativity in AI ecosystems.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and my PhD from University of Pittsburgh. My research over the last several years spanned active learning for NLP, controlled natural language generation, AI safety, and deploying AI in real-world scenarios.

I have another name that I prefer! It's Pantho. It means "wanderer" in Bengali.
