I am a second-year PhD student at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani. My current research interests span controlled natural language generation (NLG), multimodal story generation, and AI moderation of abusive content on social media.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj. Upon graduation, I focused my research on Arabic NLP and computational social science, supervised by Prof. Nizar Habash and, subsequently, Dr. Kareem Darwish.
