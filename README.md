Hello! I lead Moonworks AI, where our mission is to develop lean & agile frontier AI. Our models are powered by our own CAT pretraining, helping models learn extremely fast and outpeform others in parameter class.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and my PhD from University of Pittsburgh. My research spans active learning for NLP, controlled generation, AI safety, and real‑world AI deployment.

I also go by Pantho — Bengali for "wanderer".
