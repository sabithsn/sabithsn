Hi, I am currently pursuing PhD degree at University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Malihe Alikhani. My PhD research is focused on Natural Language Generation systems. I am currently investigating sign-language generation and summarization techniques.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. During my bachelor's, I initially pursued research in automata theory, supervised by Prof. Christos Kapoutsis. Later I developed interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My undergraduate thesis on "Interactive Evaluation and Training of Classifiers" was supervised by Prof. Bhiksha Raj. Upon graduation, I focused my research on Arabic NLP and computational social science, supervised by Prof. Nizar Habash and, subsequently, Dr. Kareem Darwish.
